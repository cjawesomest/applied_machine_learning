# Applied Machine Learning

Code developed as I studied at Drexel for my Applied Machine Learning Class.

A collection of Python Code files that implement various machine learning applications using Tensorflow and Keras. Included is also my personal notes that I took for the class from the course textbook. Note that much of the code is copied over from the textbook and was not modified to run with the most up to date APIs. If things don't work, I can try to get it to run, but I make no guarantees.
